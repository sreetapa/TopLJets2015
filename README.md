## Documentation
 
See details in the analysis twiki page https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/PbPbTTBar2018

## Running the analysis

The selection/plot filling is implemented in bin/runTTto2Lselection.cc.
It uses directly as inputs the HiForest contents.
The executable can be compiled with `scram b`.
To run on a single file for testing one  can give the command
```
make2Ltree --in /eos/cms/store/cmst3/group/hintt/PbPb2018/SkimElectrons_PromptRecov1/Chunk_1_ext0.root --out test.root
```

To loop over all the available forest trees better to use condor and then merge the outputs.
Jobs finalize in approximately 30min if queues are empty.
```
dir=/eos/cms/store/cmst3/group/hintt/PbPb2018/
a=(`ls ${dir}`)
out=/eos/cms/store/cmst3/group/hintt/PbPb2018_skim4Apr
for tag in ${a[@]}; do    
    extraOpts="true true"
    if [[ $tag == *"Skim"* ]]; then
       extraOpts=""
    fi
    python scripts/launchAnalysis.py ${dir}/${tag} $out $tag $extraOpts;
done   
```

Check that all the jobs ran fine and re-run locally if needed
```
python scripts/checkCondorJobs.py ./
```

Or you can resubmit them to the batch if there are too many. this will prompt you whether you actually want to resubmit.
```
python scripts/resubmitMissing.py ./
```

Merge the outputs (hadds all the chunks according to the tag defined)
```
python scripts/mergeOutputs.py plots
```

Plot the results
```
python scripts/makeAnalysisPlots.py plots/
```
